# E-Mobility Real-Time Data Analysis and API Queries
This repository contains code for analyzing real-time data from e-mobility sources and providing API queries for users. The code is designed to collect data from public sources, analyze it using machine learning and data visualization techniques, and provide a user-friendly API for accessing the results.

# 1. Getting Started
To get started with this code, you will need to:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies (see the requirements.txt file)
3. Configure the code to access the real-time data sources you want to analyze (see the config.ini file)
4. Run the code to collect and analyze the data and generate API queries for users

# 2. Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Flask

You can install these dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configuration
Before running the code, you will need to configure it to access the real-time data sources you want to analyze. This is done by editing the config.ini file in the root directory of the repository.

The config.ini file includes settings for the following:

*Data sources: Specify the URLs or file paths forthe real-time data sources you want to analyze.
*Data analysis: Set parameters for data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning analysis.
*API queries: Define the API endpoints and response formats for the queries you want to provide to users.

# 4. Running the Code
Once you have installed the dependencies and configured the code, you can run it using the following command:

python app.py

This will start the Flask web server and make the API endpoints available for users to query.

# 5. API Endpoints
The API endpoints provided by this code allow users to query the analyzed real-time data using a variety of parameters, such as location, time, and vehicle type. The responses to the queries can be returned in JSON, CSV, or other formats.

The API endpoints include:

1. /vehicles: Returns the current position and status of all vehicles in the real-time data sources.
2. /routes: Returns the routes and stops for a specific vehicle or location.
3. /predictions: Returns predictions for the arrival time of a vehicle at a specific stop or location.
