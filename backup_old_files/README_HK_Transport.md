  - Routes endpoint for route information
  - Stops endpoint for bus stop locations
  - Route-stops endpoint for route-specific stop sequences
  - Stop-ETA endpoint for real-time arrival data

### Customization
You can modify the following in the code:
- Map center coordinates (`HK_CENTER`) in config.py
- Hong Kong boundary coordinates (`HK_BOUNDARY`)
- KMB API endpoints and data sources
- UI styling and colors
- Chart configurations and analytics

## üìä Data Sources

- **Stop Locations**: 6,000+ bus stops with GPS coordinates
- **Real-time ETA**: Live arrival predictions for all active routes
- **Service Types**: Regular, express, and special services

### Coverage Areas
- **Primary Service Area**: Kowloon and New Territories
- **Key Terminals**: Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

2. **Map Not Loading**
   - Check internet connection (required for OpenStreetMap tiles)
   - Verify firewall settings allow map tile downloads

3. **KMB API Data Not Loading**
   - Government APIs may have rate limits or temporary outages
   - Application includes comprehensive fallback sample data
   - Check API endpoint availability at data.etabus.gov.hk

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Use the optimized version: `hk_transport_optimized.py`
   - Reduce the number of displayed routes/stops
   - Clear cache using the refresh button in sidebar

### Error Messages

- **"No KMB route data available"**: API temporarily unavailable, using sample data
- **"No KMB bus data available"**: Check route selections in sidebar
- **"Loading KMB data..."**: Normal loading state, wait for completion

**Important Notes**:
- This application focuses exclusively on KMB/LWB services
- Real-time data depends on Hong Kong Government API availability
- Sample data ensures functionality even when APIs are unavailable

> **Technical Note:**
> The KMB `/route-stop` API endpoint may occasionally return errors. The application is designed to gracefully handle these cases by falling back to curated sample data that represents actual KMB routes and stops. This ensures the dashboard remains functional and informative even during API outages.
